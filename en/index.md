## Language with simple grammar

In Wentiay-bangao, you can easily understand the part of speech by grammatical endings like Esperanto.

| Suffix |     Meaning     |
| :----: | :-------------: |
|   a    |   Adjectives    |
|   e    |     Adverbs     |
|   i    |      Verbs      |
|   o    |      Nouns      |
|   u    |  Prepositions   |
|   -    | Synthetic words |

`-` is used to create a compound word by connecting to next word.

## Roots

In Wentiayu Bangao, there are basically roots made by mixing 20 languages.
(If you are familiar with Lojban, think of it as a gismu.)
For example, nipono (Japanese) and bangao (language).
For words that are not in the root, combine the roots to make a compound word.
For example, Japanese language is a combination of nipono and bangao and is represented by nipon-bangao.

The roots are chosen to be fair to everyone.
Currently, we are in the process of deciding what kind of word should be the root.
We are looking for people who can help us choose the roots.

## Recruitment of collaborators

The Wentiay-bangao Project (WBP) is looking for volunteers.

Wentiay-bangao aims for a fair and neutral language, but unwittingly may be biased.
Also, because we are not a language expert, we may be making mistakes in your language.

We are looking for people who can help us make a list of roots and/or who are familiar with Chinese, English, Spanish, Hindi, Bengali, Portuguese, Russian, French, Arabic, Japanese, Indonesian, Urdu, German, Telugu, Turkish, Korean, Vietnamese, Javanese, Swahili and Thai.
